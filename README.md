# Unemployment
The current state of the nation due to the COVID-19 virus, a large number of US citizens are out of work to help stop the spread of the virus, resulting in a higher number of unemployment recipients. 
In my searches, I could not find a data source that shared a states unemployment payout to different demographics. In this project, I set out to create one by using current unemployment data for each state, and a national percentage of unemployment recipients based on their respective demographics.
